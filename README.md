# SQL_Practice
A collection of SQL exercises and solutions which I have practiced.

 It is designed for individuals who want to improve their SQL skills and gain hands-on experience with SQL queries.
 The repository contains a variety of exercises that cover topics such as data manipulation, database design, 
 data modeling, and more. Each exercise includes a prompt with a sample database schema and a set of questions to be answered using SQL queries.
 The solutions are also provided to help users check their work and learn from examples. 
 The SQL_Practice repository is a valuable resource for anyone looking to sharpen their SQL skills and improve their understanding of database management.
